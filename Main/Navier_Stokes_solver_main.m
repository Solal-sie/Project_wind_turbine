%% Navier-Stokes equation solver
%this program resolve navier stokes equation in 2D using Wind_Data_Lausanne.csv, 
% and map_buildings.csv. It first, calculates and projects on vertical (v) and
% horizontal (u) the mean velocities comming from south to north pasing by 
% west over a year. 
% Then the resolution of Navier-Stokes begin. We use the channel
% flow case to solve it. 
% We assume the pressure, and the velocites in both x and y directions to 
% be set at zero. This setup  represent a stationary fluid. The boundary 
% conditions are periodic in x for u, v and p at the start and at the end
% of x axis, allowing continuous flow through the horizontal edges. u and v
% are set according to the projection of the mean wind velocities over 
% a year. At y 0 start and end of the map, u and v are et to zero
% maintaining the the flux in the "channel", while the pressure gradient is
% set to zero ensuring consistent pressure across these boundaries.
% Last, the program finds the six location where the wind if the biggest 
% and creats a CSV file filled with locations and speed. 

%% Reading the different CSV files

%% Wind_direction Function
